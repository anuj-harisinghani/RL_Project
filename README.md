# RL_Project

This is my class project for the course 532J: Never Ending RL at the University of British Columbia, for Term 1 of Winter 2021. 
The project was on utilizing MAP-Elites algorithm to train a Humanoid to walk in the MuJoCo physics environment. 

MAP-Elites Algorithm: Mouret, Jean-Baptiste, and Jeff Clune. "Illuminating search spaces by mapping elites." arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.04909 (2015).
